## MicroCryptoBenchmark

This is a small benchmark covering several misuses of the JCA library.
It has been customized from the [CryptoBench](https://github.com/CryptoAPI-Bench/CryptoAPI-Bench).
The main idea here is to explore SAST tools, such as:

   * CryptoGuard
   * CogniCrypto
   * HoruSec
   * SemGrep

The results of the study have been summarized in a CSV file.
